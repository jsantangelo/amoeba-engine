For information on the software development practices, including how to make commits and when to branch, please refer to [the development process document](development_process.md).

Coding Style

Refer to [the coding style document](coding_style.md).

Getting Started
---------------

Refer to [the main README](../README.md) in the repository root.

Using Eclipse
-------------

The project can be imported into Eclipse in the same way as any other java project.  After the repository is cloned to your system, open Eclipse and select File > Import.  You can choose General > Existing Projects into Workspace, Android > Existing Android Code into Workspace, or Git > Projects from Git (if you have a git plugin installed).

Navigate to and select the folder of the repository on you system and Eclipse should recognize the AmoebaEngine project.  Select the AmoebaEngine project and be sure NOT to copy the project into the workspace.

To view the packages in the library in an easier to read format go to Package Explorer (Ctrl+F10) > Package Presentation > Hierarchical.
